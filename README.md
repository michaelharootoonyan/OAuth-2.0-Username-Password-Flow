# OAuth 2.0 Username Password Flow
 Integrated a Third Party Salesforce Application with the website using the OAuth 2.0 Username-Password Flow.  Written in PHP, following PSR-2 coding standards.

I wrote a REST endpoint in PHP and it is used in the form on the front-end in order to send over lead information and interact with the Salesforce Application.  Tested in salesforce sandbox before moving to the salesforce live environment.
